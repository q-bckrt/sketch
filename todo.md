# TODO & NOTES

*
All the main functionalities that I wanted are implemented,
with the exception of the background color management wich will be
better managed once I learn about objects and treat squares as a 2D matrix
of objects where I can store their state. This will probably allow for more
code readibality too.
*

- Improve style
    - Improve overall style, color theme etc..
    - Style the range slider
    - Fix the color picker issue where we don't currently manage to 
        remove it's default style.

- Refactor code
    - Is generally a mess, needs refactoring for more readability
    - Could probably be smaller too
    - Could maybe be faster
