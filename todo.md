- Create a shade mode wich plays with the lightness/darkness of the colors.
    - Use a percent system that increase or decrease separately the R/G/B channels values by 10%.
    - (?) Once one of them hit 255 or above (-> descend it to 255) when increasing, or same with 0 when decreasing, it stops doing anything.

- Possibility to change the background color:
    - When new background color is selected, check all squares and see if their color is equal to the background color. If yes, color them with the new background color. If not, do nothing.
    - Define the background color with the new color selected.

- Improve Style
    - The menu has no style at all for the moment, so do it from scratch
    - Would be cool to find a solution to restyle the color picker button
    - Improve the general style and color theme.
