# TODO & NOTES

*
All the main functionalities that I wanted are implemented,
with the exception of the background color management wich will be
better managed once I learn about objects and treat squares as a 2D matrix
of objects where I can store their state. This will probably allow for more
code readibality too.

- **Known Bugs:**

- **Features**

- **Other**
    - Refactor code
        - Is generally a mess, needs refactoring for more readability
        - Could probably be smaller too
        - Could maybe be faster
    
    - Improve style
        - Improve overall style, color theme etc..
        - Make the buttons reactive
        - Use SVG logos on buttons
            - Replace text with logo when hovering, or vice-versa?
