- Create a real rainbow mode.
    - There's a 'random' color mode, but we need a mode that really creates a 
        rainbow with an actual rainbow colors pattern.

- Create a shade mode wich plays with the lightness/darkness of the colors.
    - Needs to be defined more clearly

- Refactor the code, it's a mess right now.
